# ENVS-193DS_Final

This repo contains data analysis for our final assignment for ENVS 193DS. Within this repo are two sets of data: The first contains data about the effects of kangaroo rat mounds on seed banks of grass and shrublands at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge and the second data set contains data about individual and community flowering phenology, seed counts and pollinator visitation rates in shrub and open plots across Niwot Ridge. These data are publicly available and can be found using the following citations:

For this assignment, we will be using these data to answer two questions:

1) How does total seed number differ between kangaroo rat mound locations?

2) How does seed count vary with plot type (shrub or open), plant species, and total number of inflorescences? Is there a simpler model that explains seed count, and if so, what is it?

The first data set, effects of kangaroo rat mounds on seed banks of grass and shrublands at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, was recorded to determine how rat mounds affect the number of seeds, type of see

The second data set, individual and community flowering phenology, seed counts and pollinator visitation rates in shrub and open plots across Niwot Ridge, 2019 - 2021, was recorded in order to answer the questions of how shrubification may be changing flowering phenology in 21 different species and the reproductive success of 5 different alpine species. The data was recorded in four distinct data frames, in this analysis we will only be considered with seed counts and weights. This data was collected by first cataloging seeds by their individual species and what treatment they originated from and then crushing breaking up dried buds of various species and counting viable seeds.The seeds were then weighed with a microbalance.The measurements collected include: data collected, shrub number, aspect, tag number, treatment (shrub/plot), species, plant number, distance from shrub, total number of inflorescence, number of infloresecense collected, number of seeds, and weight of seeds.
