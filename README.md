# ENVS-193DS_Final

This repo contains data analysis for our final assignment for ENVS 193DS. Within this repo are two sets of data: The first contains data about the effects of kangaroo rat mounds on seed banks of grass and shrublands at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge and the second data set contains data about individual and community flowering phenology, seed counts and pollinator visitation rates in shrub and open plots across Niwot Ridge. These data are publicly available and can be found using the following citations:

For this assignment, we will be using these data to answer two questions:

1) How does total seed number differ between kangaroo rat mound locations?

2) How does seed count vary with plot type (shrub or open), plant species, and total number of inflorescences? Is there a simpler model that explains seed count, and if so, what is it?
